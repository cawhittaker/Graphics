3 scenes for graphics coursework

•	 Graphic Scenes – This work was done so we could explore how the graphics pipeline worked, this has three scenes which show off different elements of the whole process, as with the golf game we were given a graphics engine which was built by Newcastle University and used OpenGL.

Scene 1 (Cube mapping, Cube samplers, environment mapping, reflections, skybox, height map, dynamic height map, Post processing - blurring, particle effects, scene management)
Scene 2 (real-time shadow, orbiting light volume, animated mesh, ambient, diffuse and specular lighting)
Scene 3 (Frustum Culling, animated mesh, alpha objects)

All scenes ran at 60 FPS minimum
